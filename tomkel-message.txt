Hi Tomkel,

I've made this becase I haven't find any other way of contacting you, pleeease, place a email on your github profile or something so I can contact you.

I've seen you're interested in maintaining the currently archived Android Password Store project. I also want to help supporting the project because I find it very valuable.

If you are still interested in maintaining it and you are open to collaboration please let me know so I can give you more details and maybe we can work together :)
